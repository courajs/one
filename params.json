{"name":"One","tagline":"Day one of daily sites","body":"### Welcome to Crappy site #1\r\nThis was literally the easiest way for me to get a site online in 20 minutes, before I head to my high school reunion. I hope you enjoy it!\r\n\r\n### What it's about\r\nAfter leaving my last job I decided to commit some time to personal projects before I started the next job search. Unfortunately with no clear goal I was feeling a bit lost. So begins my Daily Sites challenge - publish a new web site live every single day.\r\n\r\n## Rules\r\n1. Every. Single. Day.\r\n2. It has to be alive on the internet by midnight. This means pushing something half done if necessary.\r\n3. Don't be lame. Every day has to have something unique. I don't have to start from scratch, but something has to be new. There's got to be a reason for the new site to exist.\r\n4. No regrets. Don't be a revisionist. These should stay alive forever(ish).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
